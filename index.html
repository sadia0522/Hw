<p>The stakeholders of education, namely, governments, organisations and students themselves agree on its multidimensional essentiality. High-quality education, particularly tertiary education is a major catalyst of development in families across the income spectrum. Further, with the integration of multidimensional goals, the importance of education has been accentuated and individuals have grown more conscious towards the environment and society developing an awareness lacking in previous generations.

<h3 class="Counselling">The Need for Counselling:</h3>
<p>On the flip side, a considerable number of individuals going through varying levels of education, i.e, primary, secondary and higher education often tend to become detached from their studies and find it difficult to pinpoint their interests to further assess which fields suit their interests. Consequently, this results in the high dropout rates experienced in India. In this respect, educational counselling can play a major role in aiding students in a variety of choices, namely opting for a stream/specialisation, job-related decisions and even emotional and financial support.</p>
